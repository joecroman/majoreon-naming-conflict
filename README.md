# naming-conflict
Quick resolution for naming conflict

I'm a small programmer and content creator from the small country of Portugal, who goes by the handle @majoreon everywhere on the internet. I stream on Twitch on that handle and have associated youtube, as well as several other social media profiles.

I'd really like to resolve this naming conflict here and have the majoreon username since it would really help me maintain consistency - mostly for some upcoming Content I will be making surrounding free Programming tutorials for people wanting to get an intro to Responsive Front-end.

I know it's a bit to ask but since you just made this account 8 days ago, I thought I'd reach out anyway. Since it's possible to change GitHub usernames, I'd love it if you would consider it by please reaching out to me - I'd be willing to talk out any details over through my e-mail: joecromano@gmail.com
