# majoreon-naming-conflict
Looking for a swift resolution for a naming conflict

I'm a small programmer and content creator from the small country of Portugal, who goes by the handle @majoreon everywhere on the internet. I stream on Twitch on that handle and have associated youtube, as well as several other social media profiles.

I'd really like to resolve this naming conflict here and have the majoreon username since it would really help me maintain consistency - mostly for some upcoming Content I will be making surrounding free Programming tutorials for people wanting to get an intro to Responsive Front-end.
I was trying to reach out to you but GitHub removed its messaging feature and you have zero associated links (Twitter, Public E-mail or website, etc)

I know it's a bit to ask but since you just made this account 8 days ago and likely don't share any other social accounts under the same name (since they're my accounts), I thought I'd reach out anyway to try and find a good solution that works for both of us.
Since it's possible to change GitHub usernames under your Account Settings, I'd love it if you would consider this, by please reaching out to me - I'd be willing to talk out any further/additional details over through my e-mail: joecromano@gmail.com
